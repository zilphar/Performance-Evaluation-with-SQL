# Hotel-Sales-Performance-Evaluation

**<ins> Introduction </ins>**

In this evaluation I carried out this analysis using SQL including exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine sales quarterly performance and how each quarter differed from the previous one to examine possible trends throughout the year. 

I also examine which products are doing better each quarter and generally to help the company establish a benchmark for other products encouraging performance improvement across their product line. 

I also look into the customer performance to determine customers that generally performned better than the average sales allowing the organization to identify key customer segments that drive sales to allow for targetted marketing strategies. 

Data cleaning of the dataset was carried out in Excel. 

**<ins> Questions to answer </ins>**

1. What is the quartely sales performance?
2. Which products performed generally better through the year?
3. Are there customers that performed better than the average general sales?

**<ins> Insights derived </ins>** 

1. Total quarter sales is $154, 491.95 with Q4 performing better at a total sales contribution of 29.00%. Q1 had slow performance at 15.93% contribution probably suggesting the 
post-holiday slow down which is followed by a Q2 jump to 28.11% contribution.

2. Camembert Pierrot, Alice Mutton, and Mozzarella di Giovanni where the best performing products. Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix had the least sales with Q1 and Q2 having zero sales for it suggesting a need for a market research on the product. Market research here includes gathering customer feedback on the product to monitor customer satisfaction, and make adjustments based on the feedback.
   
3. 52 out of 78 customers performed better than the overall average sales indicating that a significant portion of customers base approximately 66.7% is contributing positively to sales. This could be an indication that the customers find value in the service. While majority are performing well, the presence of underperforming customers means there is room for improvement in reaching or understanding that segment through targetted startegies.
